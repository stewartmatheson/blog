  <h3>My name is Stewart Matheson</h3>

<p>This is my space on the Internet. Here you&#8217;ll find my blog and a number of pages outlining myself and the type of person I am.</p>

<p>As my introduction text suggests I am very much into thinking outside the box. I am someone who routinely gets told by the people around me that I think far too much. However I also feel that I am the first person to suggest a different point of view. Perhaps that&#8217;s a trait of mine but I feel it&#8217;s one of the best advantages I have in this life.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t take life too seriously. I think at heart I am a bit of a clown. I love to joke around and have fun. I have a fairly laid-back personality and am always up for having a laugh, although these pages might not suggest it. The hard thing about having a joking nature like mine is to balance out having a joke and being serious. I like to think I am fairly mindful of the given situation and I know when joking time is over. It is however a fine line that people with my kind of personality walk everyday.</p>

<p>I love sitting down and breaking down a problem. There is nothing more thrilling than finding an answer that was not necessarily visible upon first glance. I get great satisfaction in working out a solution and then applying it to the problem at hand. I suppose part of that is represented in my attraction to programming.</p>

<p>I like to think that I work well with others. I consider myself a diplomatic and humble person. I have found that sometimes being diplomatic and humble is not necessarily the best way to go however I feel that it suits my personality and the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, most of the time.</p>

<p>I love technology. I love computers and the Internet. I love any technology that allows people to communicate in new and interesting ways. I have always been interested in people communicating since I first discovered the Internet all those years ago. I hope to dedicate a portion of my life to assisting people communicate. I also hope to dedicate my problem solving abilities to assist people in new ways of communicating.</p>

<p>I like to consider myself to have an innovating personality. I am someone who has creativity and always wants to find out more about a particular subject. I spend a lot of time reading about new and different things. I have a real thirst for knowledge across a number of different subjects. I like to consider myself someone who asks why not instead of why.</p>

<h3>Warning: idealistic views ahead</h3>

<p>In my culture what you do, your career is largely responsible for defining who you are. It also defines other people&#8217;s opinion of you. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with the importance on careers that some cultures place however, I do feel that a person&#8217;s career is a very important part of the essence that defines them.</p>

<p>My career is very important to me. I don&#8217;t consider myself to be a person motivated by monetary gain. I do however feel that a career is what feeds the soul. It&#8217;s difficult to ignore it, our careers largely shape how we define ourselves. I want to make sure that I am happy with the definition I have created. Therein lies the essence of my career motivation. I suppose it&#8217;s quite selfish when you break it down like that.</p>

<p>My goal in life is to be happy. Put simply I feel this should be everyone&#8217;s goal. Being happy and passionate about what you do is paramount. All of the most successful people around the world have this in common. Since learning this I have always tried to work at being passionate about what I do.
I don&#8217;t believe that the position, job or title is the sole generator of the passion. Although they help I still feel a great responsibility within myself to generate that fire, the reason for waking up in the morning. It&#8217;s not necessarily about going out and finding the best job you can. It&#8217;s more about being committed to getting the best out of what you&#8217;re doing at the time.</p>

<p>I see a lot of people looking up at the horizon and forgetting where their standing however If you&#8217;e prepared to work at it I believe that anyone can have their own dream job. It&#8217;s a goal I work towards every day.</p>
