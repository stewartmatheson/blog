I am primarily a Ruby on Rails developer however I have been lately stepping out of the rails bubble and meeting ruby in it's pure form.  I can also build PHP applications as well as Javascript applications.  I have done some API design in ruby and worked a lot with Cucumber, Rspec and Git.

I have also done small scale development operation work using Capistrano Nginx and Passenger. I have even used Apache to proxy to mongrel instances running on a server(back in the day).
