Action script three continues to impress me. Just got this warning that has saved me a lot of headache.

<pre lang="actionscript">
Warning: 1100: Assignment within conditional.  Did you mean == instead of =?
</pre>

Thanks compiler... I sure did mean == and not =.  This is so handy. Well done AS3! Keep the nice surprises coming.
