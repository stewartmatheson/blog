I have set-up a tutorial site for JavaScript with plans to add other languages. Its a getting started guide for any new programmers looking to start out with JavaScript development. If I get some positive feedback I will add more tutorials. To check them out head to <a href="http://stewtorials.rtmatheson.com" title="Stewtorials" target="_blank">Stewtorials</a>
