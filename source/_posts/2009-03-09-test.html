Welcome to "Would u prefer..." <a href="http://woulduprefer.com">Would u prefer is a fun and simple social networking application</a> asking all of the silly, the serious, and the outright ridiculous questions you can think of. You can participate in two different ways. Firstly you can answer other peoples questions and you don't even have to sign up. All you need is yourself and an opinion. Alternatively you can sign up and start asking your own questions. It's a great way to settle a beef with a family member, friend or even a co-worker. Questions can be of any nature and any subject.
