Today like other days I was working on a game in ruby.  Like any game this game uses a lot of rand().  Writing code for this game I came across this little quirk/feature of ruby.   When dividing two integers ruby will return an integer.  EG...

<pre lang="ruby">
>> 10 / 2
=> 5
</pre>

Thats fine but what about the following...

<pre lang="ruby">
>> 100 / 56
=> 1
</pre>

Ruby in this case did not return a float like I expected. It returned a rounded integer.  To get a float make sure your dividing two floats. 

<pre lang="ruby">
>> 100.to_f / 56.to_f
=> 1.78571428571429
</pre>

Thats more what I expected.  So maybe you already worked this out but it was a slight trip up for me.
