Like all developers I spend a lot of time working with text.  Everything is text in the wold of the developer. Thats why developers often obsess about what editor/IDE they use. With good reason as even the most slight increase in efficencicy can mean a lot over time.  Thanks to really smart people we have loads of different tools that do loads of different things.

Personally I use text editors. They are more versatile than IDE's which I find clunky and slow.
