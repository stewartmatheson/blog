...the other day and I wanted to share it here. But first some background. I play sports. Badly. It's more about the other guys in the team. Getting to see them week after week is awesome and it keeps you somewhat fit. The problem is it's a pain to organise. Take basketball the sport I play. Ideally in the kind of leagues that we are dealing with you want at least seven guys to show up. Six is okay five means you don't have any subs and four means you going to lose. On the flipside eight means that you might not get the best chance you could and you won't get too many minutes either. When you're paying seven dollars per game you want the right amount of minutes. It's understandable.

So what about a system that helps teams organise themselves? What about a system in which every player can login with a Web browser and declare their availability for games. It would be very helpful. I see it having the following features.
<ul>
	<li>Players to declare their availability or unavailability for games</li>
	<li>Team captains to put up the entire fixture per season</li>
	<li>Automated e-mails to players a day before the game starts as a reminder.</li>
	<li>An e-mail out to players who might not be available every week but only be available as fill-in players.</li>
	<li>A voting system for MVP awards</li>
	<li>Results from games</li>
	<li>Performances from games so how many shots someone put up or how many goals they kicked ect. ect.</li>
</ul>
More to come. But now that I'm finishing off my dissertation I have time to work on such things. Feedback?
