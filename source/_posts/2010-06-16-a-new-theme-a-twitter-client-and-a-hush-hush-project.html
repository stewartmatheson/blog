<p>Today I uploaded a new theme to this blog.&nbsp; This is the first time I have ever changed the look and the feel of this blog since its launch two years ago. It makes me happy. Change is as good as a holiday.&nbsp; I have been working on the design the in the last day and a half. Nothing special. You might not even say it's better than the last design however I can say that this is 100% my blog now. No one else on the Internet has a design like this. It was a bit sad going to other blogs and seeing the exact same design. Not any more. A pat on the back to wordpress as well. Despite the fact that it's written in PHP it's actually very easy to theme. Well done guys an excellent blogging platform.<br></p><p>There are some problems. The HTML does not validate completely however this is due to the plug-ins I am using. I noticed that all of the code causing breaking HTML validation is outputted by the various plug-ins I have installed. No bother the page seems to render okay. That said I have not tested in Internet Explorer yet.&nbsp; I'm not sure about the links on the left hand side. The event model is not working correctly sometimes the links jut up and down. I might disable the JavaScript if it gets really annoying.</p><p>I have also added my latest twitter status to the page. I love twitter and use it constantly. It will be good to have my status there. At least something on this blog will get regularly updated :-). My use of twitter has increased greatly over the last few months and I have noticed a distinct lack of any decent twitter client for Windows. That's why very shortly I will be posting my own twitter client that quite frankly leaves all of the other twitter clients I have used on Windows in its wake. It doesn't say much about existing social applications on Windows as it only took me two or three days to write.<br></p><p>With the new theme for my blog and a completed twitter client I can now focus on my dissertation. I will not have much time to post on this blog. I hopefully however will put my dissertation online and make it available for download. As many of the details are not finalised I will not go into them yet.&nbsp; I can tell you I plan to build a web server that encapsulates an artificial intelligence algorithm to serve out artificial intelligence as a normal web server would serve documents. Hopefully that wets your appetite enough to come back to this space for updates in the future.<br></p>
