Like everyone else on the rails community I am very excited about the upcoming release of rails3. I had some free time yesterday so I decided it's time to install rails 3. I had some headaches. I don't know if it's me being misinformed however I initially attempted to install rails three with Ruby 1.9.2. This was a disaster. Well not quite a disaster it wants however painful. Rails itself installed fine. The gems were configured I was just having some problems with the application generator.

I decided to cut my losses and go to Ruby 1.9.1. Again I ran into trouble. This time up problems came when I was attempting to save records into the database. This error is known to the community and I got the impression that it was the version of Ruby I was using.

In the end I decided to cut my losses and go back to Ruby 1.8.7. As Ruby 1.8.7 has proved time and time again its the version to go with. Everything is working now and I am currently using rails3.

If you're using a Mac like I am I would recommend compiling a fresh version of Ruby from source. This way you don't interfere with your previous Ruby installation. If you need to run multiple versions of Ruby I suggest you check out Ruby version manager.

I am very excited about a lot of the changes in rails three. Full credit to David and the team for acknowledging that there still is quite a hefty barrier of entry for new users. The bunder gem is a welcome addition. I think this will ease some of the pain for new users. Especially new users joining an existing rails project.Â  In addition there have been several refinements in the API. The routing API has been considerably refined and it's a much cleaner interface.

I can't wait to get moving. I got some work to do today but once I get that finished in going to start specing out my first rails3 application. WOO!
