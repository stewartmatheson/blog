I have updated the assert random gem to v 0.4.0. Â I started this update a few weeks ago but had one silly problem. I had the same problem in a different project solved it today and then applied it to assert-random. Feels good to finally get this update out the door. The update allows users to set the amount of iterations that assert random will use. Handy. You can install the gem in the usual way.
<pre>gem install assert-random</pre>
There is doc in the readme that can be viewed <a href="http://github.com/stewartmatheson/assert-random">here</a>.
