Looks like I will be blogging in octopress from now on. Looks really nice and I can host my whole blog on github. I can also blog with vim which is very cool too. Still getting the hang of things so the blog might have some weirdness over the next few weeks but everything is still here. The biggest pain is converting all my posts to markdown from html which will have to be done over time. 

I really like the idea of running right of HTML. It's a great low tech solution to dynamic webpages. It also means no database errors... and no code issues.  Static content for the win!
