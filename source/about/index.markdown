###My name is Stewart Matheson

This is my space on the Internet. Here you'll find my blog and a number of pages outlining myself and the type of person I am.

As my introduction text suggests I am very much into thinking outside the box. I am someone who routinely gets told by the people around me that I think far too much. However I also feel that I am the first person to suggest a different point of view. Perhaps that's a trait of mine but I feel it's one of the best advantages I have in this life.

I don't take life too seriously. I think at heart I am a bit of a clown. I love to joke around and have fun. I have a fairly laid-back personality and am always up for having a laugh, although these pages might not suggest it. The hard thing about having a joking nature like mine is to balance out having a joke and being serious. I like to think I am fairly mindful of the given situation and I know when joking time is over. It is however a fine line that people with my kind of personality walk everyday.

I love sitting down and breaking down a problem. There is nothing more thrilling than finding an answer that was not necessarily visible upon first glance. I get great satisfaction in working out a solution and then applying it to the problem at hand. I suppose part of that is represented in my attraction to programming.

I like to think that I work well with others. I consider myself a diplomatic and humble person. I have found that sometimes being diplomatic and humble is not necessarily the best way to go however I feel that it suits my personality and the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, most of the time.

I love technology. I love computers and the Internet. I love any technology that allows people to communicate in new and interesting ways. I have always been interested in people communicating since I first discovered the Internet all those years ago. I hope to dedicate a portion of my life to assisting people communicate. I also hope to dedicate my problem solving abilities to assist people in new ways of communicating.

I like to consider myself to have an innovating personality. I am someone who has creativity and always wants to find out more about a particular subject. I spend a lot of time reading about new and different things. I have a real thirst for knowledge across a number of different subjects. I like to consider myself someone who asks why not instead of why.

### Warning: idealistic views ahead

In my culture what you do, your career is largely responsible for defining who you are. It also defines other people's opinion of you. I don't necessarily agree with the importance on careers that some cultures place however, I do feel that a person's career is a very important part of the essence that defines them.

My career is very important to me. I don't consider myself to be a person motivated by monetary gain. I do however feel that a career is what feeds the soul. It's difficult to ignore it, our careers largely shape how we define ourselves. I want to make sure that I am happy with the definition I have created. Therein lies the essence of my career motivation. I suppose it's quite selfish when you break it down like that.

My goal in life is to be happy. Put simply I feel this should be everyone's goal. Being happy and passionate about what you do is paramount. All of the most successful people around the world have this in common. Since learning this I have always tried to work at being passionate about what I do.
I don't believe that the position, job or title is the sole generator of the passion. Although they help I still feel a great responsibility within myself to generate that fire, the reason for waking up in the morning. It's not necessarily about going out and finding the best job you can. It's more about being committed to getting the best out of what you're doing at the time.

I see a lot of people looking up at the horizon and forgetting where their standing however If you'e prepared to work at it I believe that anyone can have their own dream job. It's a goal I work towards every day.
