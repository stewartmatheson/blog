  <div class="entry-content">In my travels as a Rails developer I write or rather generate a lot of forms.  In most web applications I build it&#8217;s desirable to have forms that look uniform across the entire application. I have been working on apps where I wish I had one place to change the out put of all forms.  To solve this problem I wrote a helper that renders a partial and outputs one form look for the entire app. First lets look at the code in the view of the form

<pre lang="ruby">
  <% label = f.label :email %>
  <% element = f.text_field :email %>
  <% help = 'Please enter a valid email address' %>
  <%= form_element label, element, help %>
</pre>

Here we are in side a form_for block. This is the standard form_for block rails scaffolding builds for us.  I am setting both the label and the form element and passing it to values. I suspect there is a better way to do this with blocks. If there is please reply to my post and let me know. 

Next lets look at the form_element method.

<pre lang="ruby">
  def form_element(label, field, help)
    return render :partial => 'shared/form_element', :locals => { :label => label, :field => field, :help => help }
  end
</pre>

Basically renders a partial and passes all the values to it.  Here is the partial

<pre lang="ruby">
<p class="form_paragraph">
	<div class="label_container">
		<%= label %>
	</div>
	
	<div class="form_element">
		<%= field %> 
	</div>
	
	<div class="form_help">
		<%= help %>
	</div>

</p>
</pre>

Done.

  <div class="entry-content"><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
At the time of this posting I did not know that there was already a way to do this in rails but thanks to Robert Siemieniec for letting me know.

<pre lang="bash">
rake db:fixtures:load FIXTURES=name_of_fix_file,name_of_other_fix_file
</pre>

So just use this in the future. My solution still works if you wanted to have a separate rake task. However honestly there is no point just go with what rails has out of the box. If you really want to have your own rake task then read on.


After launching <a href="http://woulduprefer.com">Would u prefer</a> I was amazed how quickly spam started appearing on the site.  Would u prefer is a  social site that encourages casual users to post with out them being required to sign up.  While this makes the barrier to enter this site it does open doors for spam bots.  So I added a challenge system to non-signed in posters. Answer a simple question and the post will be allowed. Fail to do so and the post will not work.  Simple.  Well the implementation in the rials app was however I did hit one snag.  

How would I load the challenge questions in to the database on the production server?  I like rails fixtures so I created one for the questions.  However there is no way to add fixtures in rails one by one and I found that blank fixtures in some of my other models where overriding the existing database.  As I don&#8217;t need all my fixtures (only the one with the rails questions) I wrote a rake task that will load a single fixture.

<pre lang="ruby">
namespace :db do
  namespace :fixtures do
    desc "Load a single fixture by setting FIXTURE=name of fixture you wish to laod."
    task :load_single => :environment do
      require 'active_record/fixtures'
      ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(ActiveRecord::Base.configurations[RAILS_ENV])
      Fixtures.create_fixtures("test/fixtures", [ENV['FIXTURE']])
      puts "Fixture #{ENV['FIXTURE']} loaded in to #{RAILS_ENV} environment."
    end
  end
end
</pre>

Usage&#8230;
<pre lang="bash">
rake db:fixtures:load_single FIXTURES=questions
</pre>
Where questions is the file name of the fixture you wish to load.

Some might think it better to add this within a migration. That&#8217;s a fair call as well but I am not sure of any migration methods that are there to load fixtures. If there are let me know. I suppose a plugin would be the next step here but this quick and dirty task solves the immediate problem.

  <div class="entry-content">Today I finally updated to mod_rails.  The install was easy. I was missing a few requirements however the install process told me in exact terms what I needed to do. After rerunning the install everything worked.  The mod_rails install process seemed almost too easy. 

For those not in the know mod_rails handles everything you need to bring your rails app to production. All you have to do now is plonk your app on a server set up the database. Mod_rails does the rest.  Mod_rails also removes the need for a mongrel cluster thus reducing the amount of memory used by the server.  Very handy for users such as my self running on small hosting slices.  The configuration is also much easier. I reduced a 36 line configuration file down to 4 lines.  The only regret I have about mod_rails is that it renders <a href="http://rtmatheson.com/2009/02/installing-a-ruby-on-rails-production-server-with-mongrel-and-apache/">my post on setting up a mongrel cluster with proxy balancer</a> useless. Mod_rails &#8230; it just works. That is all.

  <div class="entry-content">I am currently building an app that has a tabbed interface. To my surprise I realized that I have never had to code a tabbed application before. I wanted an easy way to add tabs to my rails application. I used a helper method to identify what the currently selected tab is and add an active class to it.

<pre lang="ruby">
  def link_with_active(text, url)
    link = link_to text, url
    if request.request_uri == url
      return '<li class="active">' + link + '</li>'
    else
      return '<li>' + link + '</li>'
    end
  end
</pre>

Basically this method is an if statement that adds the active class to the li item. Since I would almost always build a tabbed list with an li I thought it was a safe assumption to build this in to the method.  Then I just call the helper method from my view. Like so.

<pre lang="ruby">
<ul>
	<%= link_with_active "Home", "/" %>
	<%= link_with_active "New Invoice", new_invoice_path %>
</ul>
</pre>

To be honest I am not totally sure if this is the best way to do this. If anyone has a better way of doing so please comment.

  <div class="entry-content">Recently I setup a Ruby on Rails production server.  Here is my working solution for a CentOS box however any NIX based platform should work.  I used /usr/local and compiled <strong>most</strong> software  from source.   This provides us with many advantages, but mainly it means not having to worry about someone else packaging up our software for us.  We know exactly what versions we are installing and where things have been installed to.  It is a really great way to work but may offer up some pain when first starting out.  I aim to help you with some of this pain.

Before we start ensure you have c compiler installed on your machine. Most Linux systems come with one pre-installed.  Check your distribution notes for details on this.  You will also need sudo access.
<h2>Setting up</h2>
First lets set up. Open up your terminal or login via SSH. cd to &#8220;/usr/local&#8221;.   Here create a directory(if it does not already exist) called &#8220;src&#8221; short for source.
<pre lang="bash">sudo mkdir src
sudo chmod -R 755 src/
cd src/</pre>
This is where we will download all of our&#8230; yep you guessed it source code.  The /usr/local folder does not get touched by package management systems so anything we do in this directory will be safe from automatic updates coming in and changing software on us. YAY!
<h2>A word about PATH</h2>
I might also take the time time mention PATH.  Path is a special environment veritable that has an array of locations in it. A typical path might look like
<pre lang="bash">PATH = /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin</pre>
note how &#8220;/usr/local/bin&#8221; is in this path.  This is what we need in our path as this is where we are installing our software.  As soon as we add this to our path or system we will magically know where our software is. To add this to your path edit &#8220;~/.bash_login&#8221;  and add the following line
<pre lang="bash">export PATH = /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH</pre>
Save this file and then run the file. Now /usr/local will be in our path and we can continue.

OK, we have our compiler, a src folder, sudo access and &#8220;/usr/local&#8221; in our path. Now we can start with the meaty stuff. First lets download compile and install readline.
<h2>Build and install readline</h2>
Readline is a package that aids the use of the rails console. It is a great debugging tool and worth taking the time to install it now.
<pre lang="bash">cd /usr/local/src
curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/readline-5.2.tar.gz
tar zxvf readline-5.2.tar.gz
cd readline-5.2
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
cd..</pre>
Done&#8230; note we used &#8220;&#8211;prefix=/usr/local&#8221;. This tells us that we are installing readline to the user local folder. Where our path&#8217;s will be happily waiting for it.  If you got an error during this step the chances are there is something wrong with your c compiler.  Again check your distro notes about how to best fix this.
<h2>Build and install Ruby</h2>
With readline out of the way lets install ruby.  At the time of this writing ruby 1.8.7 is what Rails recommends so lets use that.
<pre lang="bash">cd /usr/local/src
curl -O ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p72.tar.gz
tar xzvf ruby-1.8.7-p72.tar.gz
cd ruby-1.8.7-p72
./configure --enable-shared --enable-pthread --with-readline-dir=/usr/local --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
cd ..</pre>
Note &#8211;with-readline-dir=&#8221;/usr/local&#8221;. How  good is it knowing where we have installed our own software?! Again note our prefix is set to user local.  You can test this install by doing a &#8220;which ruby&#8221;. This should tell you where ruby is. If you see &#8220;/usr/local/bin/ruby&#8221; then we are using ruby in the correct place. If you see anything else then you need to check your path.  Next lets install ruby&#8217;s native package management system ruby gems.
<h2>Installing Ruby Gems</h2>
Some distros recommend against doing this as they already provide a package management system. However that does not matter as we are using &#8220;/usr/local&#8221;. See where we are going with this? ;)
<pre lang="bash">cd /usr/local/src
curl -O http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/45905/rubygems-1.3.1.tgz
tar xzvf rubygems-1.3.1.tgz
cd rubygems-1.3.1
sudo /usr/local/bin/ruby setup.rb</pre>
Done&#8230; now we have ruby gems installed. Test this by typing &#8220;gem -v&#8221; at the command line and you should see &#8220;1.3.1&#8221;. If you do, good. If not, check your path again or just comment here and I will try and help you. Evan from the land of the long white cloud(New Zealand) reported some problems with ruby gems at this stage. He said it was an issue with ruby-zlib. He and a coworker of mine where able to fix the problem by installing ruby zlib. Note if you can run the gem command with no errors at this stage you can skip this step.

<pre lang="bash">
cd /usr/local/src
curl -O http://www.blue.sky.or.jp/atelier/ruby/ruby-zlib-0.6.0.tar.gz
tar xzvf ruby-zlib-0.6.0.tar.gz
cd ruby-zlib-0.6.0
ruby extconf.rb
make
make install
</pre>

Now we can install rails. Its easy with gems.

<h2>Installing Rails</h2>
<pre lang="bash">sudo gem install rails</pre>
This might take a while as installing rails will cause a number of different gems to install.  At this point, I am going to assume that you are going to use mysql for your server.  As most production web servers will ship with mysql or some sort of database installed, I wont detail this process. However you will need both mysql and the mysql development libs to install the mysql ruby gem.  Package names differ from distro to distro, so make sure you consult your doc. If you can, do a &#8220;locate mysql_config&#8221; and find files, then you should have the development libs installed. This is the file that I use to install the mysql gem. You don&#8217;t have to install this gem, but it is recommended as it offers a serious speed boost when performing database operations. What worked for me using CentOS is&#8230;
<pre lang="bash">sudo gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/bin/mysql_config</pre>
Next lets install the mongrel gems as we will be using mongrel with apache to serve our site.
<pre lang="bash">sudo gem install mongrel mongrel_cluster</pre>
There are a swag of other gems out there used by rails developers that you might want to look in to installing at this point. However, one gem we will now install  is Capistrano.  Capistrano is a deployment tool for rails applications worthy of its own blog post.  Stay tuned for that one in the future. Don&#8217;t forget to request it from me by adding comments.
<pre lang="bash">sudo gem install capistrano</pre>
Next we need a rails app to deploy. Duh. For testing we are just going to create one right on our server. However, this most likely would be an app you have in a repository somewhere.
<h2>Setting up a test app</h2>
Again for the sake of testing I will create a scaffold, create the production database on the server and then migrate  to that database.  Once you have created your rails app, make sure you edit your database. yml file to put in the correct details for accessing your database.
<pre lang="bash">mysql -u username -p
create database testapp_production;
exit;

cd ~
rails testapp
cd testapp
./script/generate scaffold task name:string text:string
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/server</pre>
At this point you should be able to open up a browser on the server and access your site. If your doing this over SSH try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(browser)">lynx</a> its a text based browser that you can run form the command line. Ideal for testing server configurations over SSH.  With your Application up and running kill the server we have just started.  We can move on to setting up the mongrel configuration.
<h2>Mongrel configuration</h2>
Make sure your at the root of your application. Run the following.
<pre lang="bash">mongrel_rails cluster::configure -e production -p 8000 -N 3 -c /path/to/your/app -a 127.0.0.1 â€”-prefix /</pre>
This will create a configuration file in your rails app with the mongrel details you have just entered.  Here we have created 3 mongrel servers that will sit on ports 8000, 8001 and 8002 respectively.  Its like running script/server 3 times&#8230; sort of.  Next lets kick the cluster in to action with the mongrel_rails command.
<pre lang="bash">mongrel_rails cluster::start</pre>
You might want to add this to your start up.
<h2>Set up Apache</h2>
Now we can look at apache.  Apache will accept the incoming requests and decide which mongrel to dispatch the incoming request using load balancing.  There are other ways to serve rails apps but this one is good for existing apache installations.  To do this load balancing you need mod_proxy, mod_rewrite and mod_proxy_balancer all installed.  I am not going in to adding these modules, however they should not be too difficult to install if you don&#8217;t already have them using a2modenable.  The best way to set up apache with your rails app is to use a VirtualHost. Here is the  conf file that I am using

&lt;VirtualHost *:80 &gt;
ServerName yourdomain.com
RewriteEngine On
# Rewrite index to check for static
RewriteRule ^/$ /index.html [QSA]
# Rewrite to check for Rails cached page
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]
# Redirect all non-static requests to cluster
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ balancer://testapp%{REQUEST_URI} [P,QSA,L]
# â€¦â€¦.add more RewriteRule s for other apps if needed
ErrorLog logs/rails_errors_log
CustomLog logs/rails_log combined
#RewriteLogLevel 3
#RewriteLog &#8220;/home/username/testapp/log/rewrite.log&#8221;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;Proxy balancer://testapp&gt;
BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:8000
BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:8001
BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:8002
&lt;/Proxy&gt;

Add this to your httpd.conf or wherever you feel it best fits in with your app.  Remember to restart your apache server, for me its
<pre lang="bash">sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart</pre>
Once you have done this make sure your mongrel cluster is running and your site should be ready to accept incoming requests.
